            <h2>Summary of the project</h2>
           </li>
              <p>Today, in the protein data base, we have already got a lot of structures of all kinds of proteins. However, most of them are soluble protein. Up till now, very little is known about the structure of membrane protein. As we know, membrane protein is very important because of their critical functions such as ion/molecular transport, communication and energy transduction. So structure biology of membrane proteins is of great interest. </p>
<p>
We use 15N to uniformly label this protein and reconstitute it into lipid bilayers. Solid state NMR PISEMA (Polarization Inversion Spin Exchange at Magic Angle) experiments and PISA (Polar Index Slant Angle) wheel analysis are run to determine the protein's structure through 15N-1H dipolar/15N chemical shift.

<b>1. Get FID (Free induction decay) signal:</b> FID is the observable NMR signal generated by non-equilibrium nuclear spin magnetisation precessing about the magnetic field (conventionally along z). This non-equilibrium magnetisation is generally created by applying a pulse of resonant radio-frequency close to the Larmor frequency of the nuclear spins.

<b>2. EM:</b> In statistics, an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is a method for finding maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in statistical models, where the model depends on unobserved latent variables.

<b>4. Phase correction:</b>  The actual FT will make use of an input consisting of a REAL and an IMAGINARY part. In FT NMR spectroscopy, the real output of the FT is taken as the frequency domain spectrum. To see an esthetically pleasing (absorption) frequency domain spectrum, we want to input a cosine function into the real part and a sine function into the imaginary parts of the FT. This is what happens if the cosine part is input as the imaginary and the sine as the real.

<b>6. Apodization Function:</b>A function used to bring an interferogram smoothly down to zero at the edges of the sampled region. This suppresses sidelobes which would otherwise be produced, but at the expense of widening the lines and therefore decreasing the resolution.
